# alexa-skill

This is just a python code that how I made this alexa skill work.

For example and more understanding here is the link for an article http://www.auctoris.co.uk/2017/04/21/simple-python-hello-world-with-alexa/.

This file won't work alone you have to go to https://github.com/KNNCreative/alexa-skill-kit this link for how to install Alexa-skill-kit and after putting them together you can use them in AWS Lambda function. It is neccessary to put every useful library in same folder to run the Lambda function and name your Lambda function handler with "filename.handler".
